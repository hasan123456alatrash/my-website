        <h2>About Monuments</h2>

        <p class="welcome">
          Welcome to <strong>Monuments</strong>, a touristic website created to explore and present some of the world’s most iconic historical monuments. This project was developed as part of the course <strong>I2201</strong> for academic purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="welcome">
          The website focuses on famous monuments such as the ancient landmarks of <strong>Rome, Italy</strong> and the <strong>Statue of Liberty</strong> in the <strong>United States</strong>. Each monument page provides historical background, key facts, and visual content to help visitors understand the importance of these landmarks.

                The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a famous bell tower known worldwide for its unintended
                tilt. Construction began in 1173 and lasted nearly 200 years due to wars and
                engineering challenges. The tower started leaning during its construction because
                of weak and unstable soil beneath its foundation. Standing about 57 meters tall.

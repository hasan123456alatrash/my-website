            <p class="monument-description">The German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst is a World War II museum in
                Berlin located at the site where Nazi Germany signed its unconditional surrender to the Soviet Union on
                May 8, 1945. Formerly a military headquarters, the museum now focuses on the German-Soviet War (Eastern
                Front), presenting exhibits and artifacts that explain the causes, events, and consequences of one of
                the largest and deadliest conflicts of World War II.
